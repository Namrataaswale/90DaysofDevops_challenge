## Task-1 & 2

### 1. **📌 Key Tasks Completed:**

we're diving deep into Linux system administration & automation, covering key like user management, file permissions, log analysis, process control, volume mounts, and shell scripting. 💻⚙️

1️⃣ User & Group Management 🛠️
✅ Created devops_user and added them to devops_team.
✅ Set a secure password and granted sudo access.
✅ Configured SSH restrictions for enhanced security (/etc/ssh/sshd_config).

2️⃣ File & Directory Permissions 🔒
✅ Created /devops_workspace and added a file project_notes.txt.
✅ Set permissions:

Owner: Edit ✍️
Group: Read-only 📖
Others: No access 

✅ Used ls -l to verify everything is properly configured.

💡 These are fundamental Linux skills for any DevOps professional, ensuring secure access, better system control, and automation-readiness.

✅ Tasks Completed

🔹 Created a Logs Directory: Set up a dedicated logs directory and added linux_2k.log with sample log data. 📂
🔹 Error Detection with grep: Used grep to efficiently find all occurrences of "error" in the log file. 🚨
🔹 Extracted Timestamps & Log Levels with awk: Leveraged awk to extract and analyze timestamps and log levels for better insights. ⏳
🔹 Secured Logs with sed: Redacted sensitive information like IP addresses using sed to ensure data privacy. 🔒
🔹 Identified Frequent Log Entries: Used awk and sort to find the most frequent log entries, helping prioritize issues. 📊

🛠️ Why These Skills Matter

🔹Monitoring: Quickly identify errors and warnings to maintain system health.

🔹Debugging: Pinpoint issues by analyzing log patterns and timestamps.

🔹Security: Protect sensitive data by redacting or masking critical information in logs.

🔹Automation: Streamline log analysis tasks using scripts and commands.

🌟 Key Takeaways

🔹grep: A powerful tool for searching and filtering logs.
🔹awk: Perfect for extracting and processing specific fields like timestamps and log levels.
🔹sed: Essential for editing and redacting sensitive data in logs.
🔹sort & uniq: Great for identifying patterns and frequent log entries.
