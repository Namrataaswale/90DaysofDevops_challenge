# 90 Days of DevOps Challenge

Welcome to my **#90DaysOfDevOps** challenge repository! This repository documents my journey through the 90 Days of DevOps challenge, inspired by **Shubham Londhe**. The goal is to learn and practice DevOps concepts, tools, and methodologies over the course of 90 days.

## About the Challenge
The **#90DaysOfDevOps** challenge is a structured learning path to help individuals gain hands-on experience with DevOps tools, practices, and culture. The challenge is divided into **12 weeks**, with each week focusing on specific topics such as **Linux, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and more**.

ðŸ”— **You can learn more about the challenge from Shubham Londhe's original repository:** [Shubham Londhe's 90DaysOfDevOps](https://github.com/shubhamlondhe09/90DaysOfDevOps)
